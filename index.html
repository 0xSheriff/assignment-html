        <h3>Why i joined the program</h3>
        <p>I joined the School of Engineering program because I’ve always been curious about how things work and how I can use that understanding to create something meaningful. I’ve always loved solving problems and coming up with ideas to make things better, so engineering felt like the perfect fit for me.</p>
           <p>What drew me to this program specifically was the chance to learn skills that have real-world impact, like designing innovative solutions or improving the way we live. Plus, being surrounded by people who share that same drive to build and create makes it even more exciting. For me, it’s about turning ideas into reality and making a difference.</p>
